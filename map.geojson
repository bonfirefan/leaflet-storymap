Take the Mattapan Trolley, the oldest trolley train in Massachusettes and the only train to run through a cemetary in the country. Take a walk/bike along Boston's forgotten river, the Neponset, on a trail that will eventually connect Blue Hills with Castle Island (also runs parallel to Mattapan high speed line for several miles). The trolley begins running from 5:17AM, so you're free to give your day an early start.

The Boston Marathon was run for the first time in 1897, only one year after a man from the Boston Athletic Association had competed in the first Olympics in Greece. At this Adidas RunBase store on Boylston street you can find some really cool running paraphernalia (maps, photos, sneakers etc.) from some of the first runners and some recent ones too. The store also offers tons of workout classes and a running club for the more sweat-savvy. After the resilience showed by the city coming together after the marathon bombings, this is a natural way to be a part of that history and fortitude, even if you don't feel up for running 26 miles!"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.0829976,42.3487479]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":5,"chapter":"5) A Still Moment: Remembering Trayvon","zoom":17,"alt":"","image":"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54909824e4b096dd524666e5/t/576c05942e69cfe8cbcebea5/1466697116603/?format=750w","source-credit":"Source: Secret Boston","source-link":"https://www.wbur.org/artery/2014/06/18/matthew-hincman","description":"Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston Professor Matthew Hincman installed this small, covert memorial - a relief of a fallen hoodie sweatshirt.
